# Hello, welcome to my Github page!

My goal here is to learn and share knowledge about coding in C, C++, C#, JavaScript and Python. I'll make repositories with respctives language coding ant post some exercises and ideas that I'm having to improve my coding and make more clean codes. Any tips/hints are appreciated.
I'm new to this area, and with the help of online couses and github comunity I hope to reach my goals! So be patient and thanks in advance!
Maybe I'll learn another programming laguanges too, but at first, I'll focus on that I'm studying!

At thiis point, I'm a little behind the schedule with the coding that I want to learn. But, I'll improve and focus on my study. I need to get better in C to do some stuffs with My Tiva C and the MSP430 latter.
