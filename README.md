# Hello, welcome to my Github page!

My goal here is to learn and share knowledge about coding in C, C++, C#, JavaScript and Python. I'll make repositories with respctives language coding ant post some exercises and ideas that I'm having to improve my coding and make more clean codes. Any tips/hints are appreciated.
I'm new to this area, and with the help of online couses and github comunity I hope to reach my goals! So be patient and thanks in advance!
Maybe I'll learn another programming laguanges too, but at first, I'll focus on that I'm studying!
